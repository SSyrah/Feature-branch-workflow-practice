#git tag

- Used to tag specific commits for further reference.
- Especially used to mark specific point of release in history eg. "Version 2.0.5".
- After being created have no further history of commits unlike branches.
- Tags have to be explicitly passed to git push since they wont be included automatically. There are two ways to achieve this:
	1.  **git push <tagname>** – Will push singular tag with the name given
	1.  **git push --tags** – Will push all tags added.
#
##Commands
```console
git tag <name>
```
- Creates lightweight tag to the state of the repo
- Replace name with tag you want to address eg. "Version 8.6".
- Lightweight tags are essentially just a name and a pointer to a commit, useful for creating quick links to relevant commits.
#
```console
git tag -a <name> [-m] [<message>]
```
- -a is annotated tag, that contains more metadata compared to lightweight counterparts.
- They contain tagger's name, date and e-mail address.
- addin -m flag after tag name allows user to attach a message to tag in question.
#
```console
git tag
```
- Will list all tags.
#
```console
git tag [-a] <name> <commitSHA>
```
- Allows to tag older commits.
- SHA can be found with following command:
```console
git log
```
#
```console
git tag [-a] [-f] <name> <commitSHA>
```
- As previous but -f for force forces changing of the currently existing tag in case one wishes to change it.
#
```console
git checkout <name> 
```
- With this command you can check state of the repo at this specific point of time the tag is referencing to.
#
```console
git tag -d <name>
```
- Deletes the given tag.
