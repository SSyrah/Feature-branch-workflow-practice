## git stash

-- takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy
-- you're free to make changes, create new commits, switch branches, and perform any other Git operations; then come back and re-apply your stash when you're ready.
-- Note that the stash is local to your Git repository; stashes are not transferred to the server when you push.

git stash pop
-- removes the changes from your stash and reapplies them to your working copy

git stash apply
--  you can reapply the changes to your working copy and keep them in your stash

git stash -u (or --include-untracked)
