# git amend
- Used to modify most recent commit.
- Lets one to combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating completely new one.
- Doesn't modify the commit but rather replaces it completely.
- Mainly used to change commit messages that have been made by accident or prematurely. ie fix typos or any other brain drain results.
- **Highly recommended to be used on public commits.**
    - Amending essentially remove the previous branch leading to complicated issues in case some other developer has already started working on the commit in question.
