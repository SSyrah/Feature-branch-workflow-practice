# Merge 3-way

- Used when branches have diverged from each other and there is no clear relation between them.
- Name comes from git's way to use three commits in order to merge branches and their histories.
	1. The last commit from the merging branch.
	1. The last commit from the target branch.
	1. The last commit of the commone ancestor.
- Used to merge bigger features to the master branch.
- Common when several developers are working on a project in concert.
#
- If two or more files have been changed on the same part, git can't process by itself which file to use.
- Result is a merge conflig that developer has to resolve by hand.
 	- Git stops progressing with the merge upon each conflict is finds.
	- Will continue once developer has sorted out the presented collusion.
#
- Syntax is same as with git merge, no additional flags required:
```console
git merge <branch>
```
