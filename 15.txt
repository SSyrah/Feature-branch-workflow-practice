## git rebase

-- one of two Git utilities that specializes in integrating changes from one branch onto another.
-- It has powerful history rewriting features

git rebase <base>
-- Git rebase in standard mode will automatically take the commits in your current working branch and apply them to the head of the passed branch.

git rebase --interactive <base>
-- begins an interactive rebasing session. Instead of blindly moving all of the commits to the new base, interactive rebasing gives you the opportunity to alter individual commits in the process. 
-- This lets you clean up history by removing, splitting, and altering an existing series of commits. It's like Git commit --amend on steroids.

git rebase --abort
-- undo the git rebase
