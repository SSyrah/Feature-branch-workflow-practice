## git reflog

-- Reflog allows you to go back to commits even though they are not referenced by any branch or tag. 
-- contains information about the old state of branches and allows you to go back to that state if necessary.
-- reflog entries have an expiration date. The default expiration time for reflog entries is 90 days.
-- provides a safety net if changes have been committed to your local repository and that it only tracks movements of the repositories branch tip.
