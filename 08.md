# Merge fast-forward

Default option when using, can also be used with flag -ff
```console
git merge <branch>
```

- Used when there is linear path from the current branch tip to the target branch.
- Git is not actually merging branches but rather integrates histories of each branch
- Effectively combines histories
- Makes all commits of the merging branch available to other

```console
git merge -no-ff <branch>
```

- Reverse command
- Provides better tracking for commits done in branch
